## Python

### [Slug Collector üêå](https://github.com/hey-august/scripts/tree/main/python/slug-collector)

Slug Collector is a simple Python script that traverses a directory for Markdown (`.md`) and Markdown React (`.mdx`) files,
collects the slug defined in the YAML front matter (if any), and outputs the resulting list in a text file.

#### Usage

1. Create a virtual environment
2. Install `PyYAML`
3. Navigate to the directory of Markdown or Markdown React files in Terminal
4. Activate the virtual environment
```
source ~/path/to/.venv/bin/activate`
```
6. With your shell inside the desired directory, run the script
```
python3 ~/path/to/python/script/collect_slugs.py .
```
8. Collect your new list of slugs from `slugs_output.txt`
